## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
if(!require("readr")){
  install.packages("readr")
}
sink("report.txt")
Sys.getenv()
Sys.getlocale()
readr::locale()
sessionInfo()
sink()
warning(
  'Please upload the following file: \n',
  file.path(getwd(),"report.txt"),
  '\nto the following website:\n',
  'https://forms.gle/vPoQ1MC4cNEJuNqM8'
)
source("https://www.dropbox.com/s/mk7bxvu6a3lxf79/studentEnvironmentReport.R?dl=1",print.eval = T)
